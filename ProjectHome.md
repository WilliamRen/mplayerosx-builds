## About ##
These are some Mac OSX builds of mplayer2 (http://www.mplayer2.org/). Yes, you guessed it right: compared to the original mplayer (1) this one has some additional features (http://www.mplayer2.org/comparison.html).

We provide two versions of the binary: one that works embedded in the MPlayerOSX Extended GUI. The other, Standalone, is for advanced users that may want more features/speed/quality at the cost of ease of use.
